* Action Items
** TODO replace =hyper= with =reqwest=
** TODO add blake3 support for blob checksums
** Milestones
*** Packing objects to reduce disk usage
**** should be configurable, not obvious that this is always a good idea
**** combine blobs into compressed ~pack~ files once there are many loose blob files
**** track loose blobs with in-memory counter; on startup, count loose files
**** deleting a blob results in a tombstone if blob is packed
**** provide function to perform garbage collection (repacking)
- iterate all packs, moving blobs into new packs
**** use =exaf-rs= for the container format
***** need API for extracting a single entry by relative path within archive
**** use SQLite to map blob checksums to pack files
- if row exists, blob is packed
- row contains column for hash/name of pack
- row contains column for deleted flag (tombstone)
**** cache frequently accessed (packed) blobs in memory
**** function to rebuild blob index as needed
- iterate all pack files, build database table
*** Server-side encryption
**** Amazon Web Services offers this with S3
**** seemingly creates encryption keys for each bucket
**** c.f. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html
**** probably necessary because S3 objects are often publicly visible
**** keys and blobs cannot be stored on the same system, making this difficult
