* Action Items
** Milestones
*** Packing objects to reduce disk usage
**** combine blobs into large ~pack~ files
**** blob delete results in a tombstone if blob is packed
**** provide function to perform garbage collection
**** c.f. http://shafiul.github.io/gitbook/7_the_packfile.html
**** index is for quickly finding a blob, nothing more
*** Server-side encryption
**** Amazon Web Services offers this with S3
**** seemingly creates encryption keys for each bucket
**** c.f. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html
**** probably necessary because S3 objects are often publicly visible
**** keys and blobs cannot be stored on the same system, making this difficult
