* Action Items
** Milestones
*** Packing objects to reduce disk usage
**** combine blobs into compressed ~pack~ files once there are many loose blob files
**** deleting a blob results in a tombstone if blob is packed
**** provide function to perform garbage collection (repacking)
**** use =exaf-rs= for the container format
**** use RocksDB or SQLite as index of blobs to pack files, tombstones
**** cache frequently accessed (packed) blobs in memory
*** Server-side encryption
**** Amazon Web Services offers this with S3
**** seemingly creates encryption keys for each bucket
**** c.f. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html
**** probably necessary because S3 objects are often publicly visible
**** keys and blobs cannot be stored on the same system, making this difficult
